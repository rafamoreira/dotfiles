ARCH INSTALL SCRIPTS
====================

This is a set of scripts that I use for an arch full install.

ATTENTION
=========

All scripts are very simple, but tailored to my system needs specially the partitioning step.
Edit it first to avoid data loss.

There is some checks for a machine install or a vmware/virtualbox install, but not enough to customize a install.

My intention is to expand a bit on the scripts mainly on the partiotining phase, but it will never be a total hands off install procces, so procced with caution.
